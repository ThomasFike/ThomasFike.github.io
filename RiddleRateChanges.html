				<h2>Method Of Reporting</h2>
				<p>These Documents are produced to inform students of the rate changes made by the Embry-Riddle Prescott
					Campus over time. You will notice that housing and meal plans are not a part of this and that is
					because they are not the same for all students. This report is broken into two different parts first
					being an analysis of the tuition and fee changes during my time at Riddle. This first report shows
					per semester. The other is a report based off of the tuition cost of the year reported on the riddle
					page accessed via <a
						href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100901000000*/https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/estimated-costs">https://web.archive.org/web/20100901000000*/https://prescott.erau.edu/admissions/estimated-costs</a>.
					This shows the yearly totals again only for tuition and fees. There are both the images and the
					excel spreadsheet if you want to look at the data. These reports are in response to the current
					petition. These reports are not a statement of how you should feel, they are simply data so you can
					make your own informed position. </p>
