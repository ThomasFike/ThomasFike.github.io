## High School Years
In high school I was involved in the arts relatively heavily. I started singing in choirs as young as I can remember and this was no different in high school. For 3 of my 4 years I was a member of my schools top choral group. As a member of the group I was able to go on tour and to competitions. I was also involved in drama but not on stage. I was a sound tech and later a sound lead. I enjoyed being able to bring a show to life by the use of sound effects. Just before high school I became involved in amateur radio. I was able to serve as the vice president of the West Valley Amateur Radio Club at the age of 14 and 15 years old. Summer going into junior year I got a new hobby, indoor rock climbing. I climbed for about three months before I started working at the gym I went to as youth climbing instructor. I then worked my way up from being a general customer service person to being a manager.
## College
When I was in sophomore year of high school I decided that I wanted to go Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona. I graduated in May of 2022 with a degree in Electrical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science. While there I served in many different organization in many different roles. I was the communications/RF team lead for ERAU's CubeSat program EagleSat-2. I also had the privilege of being the project lead for a high altitude balloon project called ASCEND. I served as the secretary and later President of the Eagle Amateur Radio Club. I was also a Campus Academic Mentor for the College of Engineering. In this position I served to lead students in both their academic and professional success. I was also an officer for IEEE and member of Tau Beta Pi.
