                <h2>Growing Up</h2>
                <p>I was born in San Diego, California in June of 2000. I only lived in San Diego for six months though
                    as then my parents moved back to Phoenix, Arizona. I started my journey into technology early in
                    life by fixing mac books starting in the third grade. This continued up thru middle school where I
                    would fix computer carts for the library as a part of gen yes.</p>
                <h2>High School</h2>
                <p>In high school I was involved in the arts relatively heavily. I started singing in choirs as young as
                    I can remember and
                    this was no different in high school. For 3 of my 4 years I was a member of my schools top choral
                    group. As a member of
                    the group I was able to go on tour and to competitions. I was also involved in drama but not on
                    stage. I was a sound
                    tech and later a sound lead. I enjoyed being able to bring a show to life by the use of sound
                    effects. Just before high
                    school I became involved in amateur radio. I was able to serve as the vice president of the West
                    Valley Amateur Radio
                    Club at the age of 14 and 15 years old. Summer going into junior year I got a new hobby, indoor rock
                    climbing. I climbed
                    for about three months before I started working at the gym I went to as youth climbing instructor. I
                    then worked my way
                    up from being a general customer service person to being a manager.</p>
                <h2>College</h2>
                <p>When I was in sophomore year of high school I decided that I wanted to go Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
                    University in
                    Prescott, Arizona. I am now a sophomore and am studying electrical engineering and am minoring in
                    computer science. I
                    serve as the communications/RF team lead for our CubeSat program EalgeSat-2. I also have the
                    privilege of being the
                    project lead for a high altitude balloon project called ASCEND. I served as the secretary of the
                    Eagle Amateur Radio
                    Club but have recently became the president. My interests are mostly in computer engineering and
                    embedded systems.</p>
